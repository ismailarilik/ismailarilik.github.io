Welcome to My Personal Website!

I am a Lead Software Engineer working at [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/).
I am a [Silver Sponsor](https://joinmastodon.org/sponsors) of [Mastodon decentralized social media platform](https://joinmastodon.org/).

I am reading [rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org) nowadays so maybe one day I can contribute to [the Rust compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

I am always open to new exciting opportunities so feel free to contact me anytime.

You can follow me using social media accounts below to get updates from me.
